# debug

Prompt the user to inform you what exactly needs to be debugged. Then, use puppeteer to open the app and check the console and see if there are any errors. If there are, troubleshoot until no errors are found or you need my interaction.

## IMPORTANT: Sound Notification

After finishing responding to my request or running a command, run this command to notify me by sound:

```bash
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff
```
