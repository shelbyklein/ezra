# Plan
look at @claude_docs and understand the context of where we are with the project. Use puppeteer to get an idea about what UI/UX is important for the context of the plan. Use sequential thinking to propose the next steps.

## IMPORTANT: Sound Notification

After finishing responding to my request or running a command, run this command to notify me by sound:

```bash
afplay /System/Library/Sounds/Funk.aiff
```
