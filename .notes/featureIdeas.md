# Ideas for future features

- notebooks/folders/pages should be taggable
- tag view to consolidate projects with notes - quick access between the two
- add a breadcrumb that shows where we are in the app (according to the chat)

# Bugs

- why is there a board tab
- staring doesnt do anything
- when im in a project the breadcrumb reads home > board, it should read home > [project name]
