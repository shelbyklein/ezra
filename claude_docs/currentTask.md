## Active Task
AI Integration and Keyboard Shortcuts:
- ðŸ”„ Keyboard shortcuts for efficiency
  - N for new task, E for edit selected
  - Del for delete, Space for status change
  - Arrow keys for navigation
- ðŸ”„ AI integration for task enhancement
  - Anthropic Claude API integration
  - "Enhance with AI" button in forms
  - Smart suggestions for task details

## Next Steps
1. Implement keyboard shortcuts (N for new task, E for edit, etc.)
2. Integrate Anthropic Claude API for task enhancement
3. Add API key management in user settings
4. Add "Enhance with AI" button to task forms
5. Create loading states for AI operations
6. Consider implementing:
