## Immediate Priority: Complete MVP (Phase 1)

### 1. AI Integration with Claude API (Critical - 1-2 days)
This is the key differentiator for Ezra. Implementation plan:

#### Backend Tasks:
- [x] Install Anthropic SDK: `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
- [x] Create AI utility module (`backend/utils/anthropic.ts`)
- [x] API key storage and encryption implemented
- [ ] Add API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/tasks/:id/enhance` - Enhance existing task
  - `POST /api/ai/suggest-tasks` - Suggest tasks based on project
- [ ] Add rate limiting for AI endpoints
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully

#### Frontend Tasks:
- [ ] Add "Enhance with AI" button to CreateTaskForm
- [ ] Add "Enhance" button to TaskDetailModal edit mode
- [ ] Create loading states for AI operations
- [ ] Show AI suggestions in a reviewable format
- [ ] Allow users to accept/reject AI enhancements

#### API Key Management:
- [x] Add `anthropic_api_key` column to users table (encrypted)
- [x] Create API key settings in Account tab
- [x] Validate API keys before storing
- [x] Use user's API key for AI operations

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts (Nice to have - 1 day)
Improve productivity with keyboard navigation:

- [ ] Create `useKeyboardShortcuts` hook
- [ ] Implement shortcuts:
  - `N` - New task (open create form)
  - `E` - Edit selected task
  - `Delete` - Delete selected task (with confirmation)
  - `1/2/3` - Focus Todo/In Progress/Done column
  - `?` - Show keyboard shortcuts help
- [ ] Add visual indicators for shortcuts
- [ ] Create help modal showing all shortcuts

### 3. Polish & UX Improvements (1 day)
Final touches for professional feel:

- [ ] Add empty state illustrations for columns
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- [ ] Implement task search/filter functionality
- [ ] Add task count badges to project cards
- [ ] Improve mobile drag-and-drop experience
- [ ] Add success animations for task operations

### 4. Testing & Documentation (1 day)
Ensure reliability and maintainability:

- [ ] Write unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Update README with:
  - Setup instructions
  - Feature overview
  - Screenshots
  - API key setup guide
- [ ] Create user guide for AI features

## Phase 2: Notebook System ✅ COMPLETED
The notebook system has been fully implemented with:

- ✅ TipTap WYSIWYG editor with rich formatting
- ✅ Hierarchical folder structure
- ✅ Drag-and-drop file management
- ✅ Auto-save functionality
- ✅ Slash commands for quick formatting
- ✅ Visual file/folder icons
- ✅ Drag to root functionality

### Future Notebook Enhancements:
- [ ] AI-powered content generation
- [ ] Link notebooks/pages to tasks and projects
- [ ] Full-text search across all pages
- [ ] Export to PDF/Markdown
- [ ] Collaborative editing

## Phase 3: Mind Mapping (Future - 2 weeks)
Knowledge management expansion:

1. **Canvas Implementation**
   - React Flow integration
   - Node types (text, image, link, task)
   - Connection types
   - Zoom/pan controls

2. **AI Mind Map Generation**
   - Generate mind maps from project descriptions
   - Suggest connections between nodes
   - Auto-layout algorithms
   - Export to various formats

## Technical Debt & Optimization
Ongoing improvements:

- [ ] Migrate to PostgreSQL for production
- [ ] Implement Redis caching
- [ ] Add WebSocket for real-time updates
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Add error boundary components
- [ ] Implement proper logging system
