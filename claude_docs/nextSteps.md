## Immediate Priority: Complete MVP (Phase 1)

### 1. AI Integration with Claude API (Critical - 2-3 days)
This is the key differentiator for Ezra. Implementation plan:

#### Backend Tasks:
- [ ] Install Anthropic SDK: `npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk --workspace=backend`
- [ ] Create AI service module (`backend/src/services/ai.service.ts`)
- [ ] Add API endpoints:
  - `POST /api/tasks/:id/enhance` - Enhance existing task
  - `POST /api/ai/suggest-tasks` - Suggest tasks based on project
- [ ] Add rate limiting for AI endpoints
- [ ] Handle API errors gracefully

#### Frontend Tasks:
- [ ] Add "Enhance with AI" button to CreateTaskForm
- [ ] Add "Enhance" button to TaskDetailModal edit mode
- [ ] Create loading states for AI operations
- [ ] Show AI suggestions in a reviewable format
- [ ] Allow users to accept/reject AI enhancements

#### API Key Management:
- [ ] Add `api_key` column to users table (encrypted)
- [ ] Create API key settings in Account tab
- [ ] Validate API keys before storing
- [ ] Use user's API key for AI operations

### 2. Keyboard Shortcuts (Nice to have - 1 day)
Improve productivity with keyboard navigation:

- [ ] Create `useKeyboardShortcuts` hook
- [ ] Implement shortcuts:
  - `N` - New task (open create form)
  - `E` - Edit selected task
  - `Delete` - Delete selected task (with confirmation)
  - `1/2/3` - Focus Todo/In Progress/Done column
  - `?` - Show keyboard shortcuts help
- [ ] Add visual indicators for shortcuts
- [ ] Create help modal showing all shortcuts

### 3. Polish & UX Improvements (1 day)
Final touches for professional feel:

- [ ] Add empty state illustrations for columns
- [ ] Add loading skeletons for better perceived performance
- [ ] Implement task search/filter functionality
- [ ] Add task count badges to project cards
- [ ] Improve mobile drag-and-drop experience
- [ ] Add success animations for task operations

### 4. Testing & Documentation (1 day)
Ensure reliability and maintainability:

- [ ] Write unit tests for critical components
- [ ] Create API documentation
- [ ] Update README with:
  - Setup instructions
  - Feature overview
  - Screenshots
  - API key setup guide
- [ ] Create user guide for AI features
