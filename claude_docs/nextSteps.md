# Next Steps - Ezra Development

## Immediate Priority: Frontend MVP Implementation

### 1. Frontend Setup and Dependencies
```bash
cd frontend
npm install @dnd-kit/core @dnd-kit/sortable @dnd-kit/utilities
npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
npm install @tanstack/react-query
npm install react-hook-form
```

### 2. Authentication Implementation
- [ ] Create AuthContext for managing authentication state
- [ ] Build Login and Register components
- [ ] Implement token storage and management
- [ ] Set up axios interceptors for auth headers
- [ ] Create ProtectedRoute component
- [ ] Add logout functionality

### 3. Project Management UI
- [ ] Create ProjectList component for displaying all projects
- [ ] Build CreateProjectModal with form validation
- [ ] Implement project selection and switching
- [ ] Add project edit/delete functionality
- [ ] Create ProjectContext for current project state

### 4. Kanban Board Implementation
- [ ] Create Board component layout
- [ ] Build Column components (Todo, In Progress, Done)
- [ ] Create TaskCard component with drag handles
- [ ] Implement drag-and-drop with @dnd-kit
- [ ] Add visual feedback during drag operations
- [ ] Handle task reordering API calls

### 5. Task Management
- [ ] Create AddTaskForm component
- [ ] Build TaskDetailModal for viewing/editing
- [ ] Implement quick actions (status change, delete)
- [ ] Add task filtering and search
- [ ] Create keyboard shortcuts for common actions

### 6. State Management
- [ ] Set up React Query for server state
- [ ] Implement optimistic updates for drag-and-drop
- [ ] Create custom hooks for API operations
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic
- [ ] Implement loading states

### 7. UI Polish and UX
- [ ] Add loading skeletons
- [ ] Implement toast notifications
- [ ] Create empty states
- [ ] Add animations and transitions
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness

### 8. Basic AI Integration
- [ ] Add AI enhancement button to task forms
- [ ] Create API endpoint for Claude integration
- [ ] Implement task description enhancement
- [ ] Add AI-powered task suggestions

## Development Order Recommendation

1. **Start with Authentication** - Required for all other features
2. **Project Management** - Need projects before creating tasks
3. **Basic Board Layout** - Visual structure first
4. **Drag and Drop** - Core functionality
5. **Task CRUD** - Complete the workflow
6. **Polish and AI** - Enhance the experience

## Testing Considerations
- Test authentication flow end-to-end
- Verify drag-and-drop across different scenarios
- Ensure API error handling works properly
- Test on different screen sizes
- Validate form inputs and error states

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)
- Real-time collaboration with WebSockets
- Advanced filtering and views
- Bulk operations
- Keyboard navigation
- Export functionality
- Analytics dashboard
