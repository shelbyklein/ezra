# Ezra Development Roadmap

## Vision
Build an intuitive personal project management tool that helps individuals organize and execute their work efficiently, with optional AI enhancements added progressively.

## Development Approach
Core functionality first, AI features later. This ensures a stable, working product that can be enhanced with intelligent features once the foundation is solid.

#### Technical Foundation
- [ ] TypeScript project setup
- [ ] Core data models (Project, Task)
- [ ] Repository pattern implementation

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Success Criteria
- Create and manage projects/tasks via CLI
- Data persists between sessions
- All commands work reliably
- 90%+ test coverage

### Phase 2 Success Criteria
- Full task management capabilities
- Useful analytics without AI
- Import/export working
- Performance < 100ms for operations

### Phase 3 Success Criteria
- Intuitive web interface
- API with full documentation
- Real-time sync working
- Mobile responsive

### Phase 4 Success Criteria
- AI features enhance but don't break core
- Natural language works 80%+ of time
- Graceful fallbacks
- User satisfaction increased

## Architecture Principles

### Core First
- Every feature works without AI
- AI enhances but never replaces
- Structured commands always available
- Local-first operation

### Progressive Enhancement
- Start simple, add complexity
- Each phase builds on previous
- Features are optional
- Backward compatibility

### User Control
- AI features can be disabled
- Privacy-first approach
- Transparent operations
- Export everything

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **No AI Dependency**: Core works without any AI
- **Simple Architecture**: Start with monolith, refactor later
- **SQLite First**: No database server needed initially
- **TypeScript**: Type safety from the start

### User Adoption
- **Quick Value**: Usable product in 3 weeks
- **Familiar Patterns**: Standard CLI conventions
- **Progressive Learning**: Features introduced gradually
- **Clear Documentation**: Every command documented

This roadmap prioritizes delivering a working, useful product quickly, then enhancing it with advanced features including AI. The core product will always work independently of any AI services.
