## Example Interactions

```
You: "I need to plan a mobile app development project"
Ezra: "I'll help you set up a mobile app project. What's the app about?"

You: "It's a fitness tracking app with social features"
Ezra: "Great! I've created the 'Fitness Tracking App' project. Based on typical mobile app development, I suggest these initial phases:
1. Requirements & Design (2-3 weeks)
2. Backend Development (3-4 weeks)
3. Frontend Development (4-5 weeks)
4. Testing & Deployment (2 weeks)

Would you like me to break these down into specific tasks?"
```
